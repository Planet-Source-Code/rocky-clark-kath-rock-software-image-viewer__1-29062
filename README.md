### Description

A great application for viewing entire folders of images. No limit to the number of images in the folder. Much better than a thumbnail viewer, this program shows each image at full size in a tab style design. Add and delete tabs for quick reference between images. This code also demonstrates the use of system ImageLists in a ListView. Features OLE drag and drop from Explorer. As an added bonus this application comes with the KRScroll scroll bar OCX (Sorry, no source code for the Kath-Rock KRScroll, but you can use it in your own apps, no license required. Note: Enough good votes may get you the KRScroll code next). Please view the ReadMe.txt file before opening the code in VB.

UPDATE 

----

Planet Source Code removed the KRScroll.ocx from the zip file. Please go to Kath-Rock.com to download the entire project with the ocx.
